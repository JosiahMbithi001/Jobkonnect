JobKonnect is a web-based platform that aims to connect employers and employees by providing a convenient and efficient way for employers to post job openings and for job seekers to apply for those positions. The platform allows users to search for jobs based on location and type, providing a streamlined experience for both employers and job seekers.

Features

## Employer Features

Post Jobs: Employers can easily create and post job openings on JobKonnect. They can provide detailed job descriptions, including the position title, required qualifications, responsibilities, and any additional information they deem necessary.

Manage Job Listings: Employers have the ability to view, edit, and remove job listings they have posted. This feature allows them to keep their job postings up to date and remove listings once they have been filled.

Location-based Listings: Employers can specify the location of the job opening, ensuring that the listing appears in the search results for job seekers who are interested in opportunities in that particular area.

Review Applications: Employers can review and manage applications submitted by job seekers. They have access to applicant information, such as resumes and cover letters, allowing them to evaluate candidates effectively.

Communication: JobKonnect provides a communication channel between employers and job seekers. Employers can initiate contact with potential candidates through the platform's messaging system.

## Job Seeker Features

Search Jobs: Job seekers can search for job opportunities based on their desired location and job type. This feature allows them to filter the available job listings to find positions that align with their preferences.

Apply to Jobs: Job seekers can submit their applications directly through JobKonnect. They can upload their resumes, write cover letters, and provide any additional information requested by the employer.

Saved Jobs: JobKonnect allows job seekers to save job listings that they find interesting for future reference. This feature simplifies the job search process by providing a centralized place for managing and tracking preferred job opportunities.

Receive Job Alerts: Job seekers can opt to receive email or push notifications for new job openings that match their specified criteria. This ensures that they stay updated with relevant job opportunities in their desired location and field.

Communication: JobKonnect facilitates communication between job seekers and employers. Job seekers can receive messages from employers regarding their applications and engage in further discussions related to the job.

## Technologies Used:

Frontend: The frontend of JobKonnect is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks like Tailwindcss and/or Bootstrap may be utilized to enhance the user interface and provide a responsive design.

#### Backend: 

The backend is powered by a server-side language Python, which interacts with the database and handles the business logic. The Django will be used to expedite development.

#### Database: 

Django built-in database management system sqlite was used to generate and store data from tables defined in a models folder. The data stored is related to job listings, employers, job seekers, and applications.

*** Authentication: ***

To ensure secure user authentication and authorization, a robust authentication system (django auth and csfr_token)will be implemented.

*** Deployment: ***

The application can be deployed on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Heroku for scalability and accessibility.
